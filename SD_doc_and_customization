### **1. Sales Phase**

The Sales Phase involves creating and managing sales orders, which are agreements between a company and a customer to deliver products or services under specific terms.

#### **1.1 Sales Order Processing**
- **Sales Order:** The central document in the sales process that records the customer's request for products or services.
